# Fake News and Media Bias Detection System
## Python, Transformers, PyTorch, MongoDB, RSS, NLP
Developed an automated system that collects news articles from global RSS feeds (e.g., BBC, CNN, Reuters) and uses advanced machine learning models to detect fake news and media bias. The system integrates BERT-based models for sentence-level classification, performs sentiment analysis using TextBlob, and stores analyzed articles in a MongoDB database. Implemented real-time logging, keyword extraction, and automated scheduling for hourly scraping and analysis. Ensured model loading reliability and data redundancy via CSV backups.
